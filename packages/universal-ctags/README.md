universal-ctags
===============

Parent: [build-locally](../../README.md)

Builds the universal-ctags package. See [ Universal-ctags home page](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)

The driver for this is https://askubuntu.com/a/947219/340383 that
referred to a script that insisted upon using exhuberant-ctags but the
exhuberant-ctags seems to have been abandoned, but then subsequently
replaced by the univeral-ctags package.
