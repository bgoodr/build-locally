mlocate
====

Parent: [build-locally](../../README.md)

Builds the mlocate package. See [mlocate home page](http://mlocate.sourceforge.net/)

Don't be fooled by what you read on the web.  The page at

  https://pagure.io/mlocate.git mlocate

is very old and it does not build. But Debian builds it, and the
linux/build.bash uses the git repo from Git for some recent version of
Debian.
