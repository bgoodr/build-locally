  #
  #   librsvg2-devel
  #   dbus
  #   atk-devel
  #   cairo-devel
  #   libXi-devel

  #   giflib-devel
  #   libtiff-devel
  #   bitstream-vera-fonts <-- not any more; see git controlled .fonts directory
  #
  # But here is what the admins actually found on 2012-10-19:
  #
  #   All of the packages below were on the RHEL6 system by default, except for:
  #   
  #   giflib-devel
  #   libtiff-devel
  #   bitstream-vera-fonts
  #   
  #   libtiff-devel is part of the distribution, the admin will have to
  #   add that to the system.
  #   
  #   giflib-devel is no longer part of the ISO distribution but RedHat
  #   does carry it in one of the repositories on their site, so the
  #   admin will have to install it on the system.
  #   
  #   bitstream-vera-fonts is not available for RHEL6, but my hackaround
  #   was to just copy them from a Debian wheezy/sid release and store
  #   them under git under ~/.fonts (they are platform-independent files
  #   anyhow, and I could not find the right CentOS RPM to scavenge them
  #   from!).
  #
  #   Sun Apr 23 09:58:08 PDT 2017: libpng is not on RHEL 6.8 by default
  #   so it is now added as a build dependency below.
